 Tic-Tac-Toe Oriented Object Programming
Our project name is Tic-Tac-Toe game. This game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself. It is actually a two player game. In this game, there is a board with n x n squares. In our game, it is 3 x 3 squares. The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally  on a 3 x 3 grid.
Our main purpose to develop this  game its to be more familiar with C# programming ,and we try to make this game more oriented object as possible we can.
